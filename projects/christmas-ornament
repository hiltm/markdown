# Christmas Ornament
## Project Overview
In my professiomal life, I have laid out multiple printed circuit boards including circuit design, board layout, and fabrication documentation. However, I wanted to have some projects to display that were not owned by the organizations that I could show off on my portfolio. Starting a (presumably) simple project to get my workflow set up. The project I have planned is a Christmas ornament that lights up my last name in LEDs.
