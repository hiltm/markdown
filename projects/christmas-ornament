# Christmas Ornament
## Project Overview
In my professiomal life, I have laid out multiple printed circuit boards including circuit design, board layout, and fabrication documentation. However, I wanted to have some projects to display that were not owned by the organizations that I could show off on my portfolio. Starting a (presumably) simple project to get my workflow set up. The project I have planned is a Christmas ornament that lights up my last name in LEDs.

## Project Requirements/Desires
* done in Altium
* 2 layer board
* circular PCB form
* powered from coin battery
* green and red LEDs
* an on/off switch
* a speaker and Christmas songs saved

## Next Steps/ToDos
* set up Altium personal templates
    * used [Altium Templates from Github user Fermium](https://github.com/Fermium/AltiumTemplates)
* set up personal part number tracking
    * perhaps not very interesting but XXX-YYYY where XXX is sequential project number depending on what's being worked and YYYY is another sequential for new part numbers within a project
* set up part footprint repository
    * this is also kept in the personal templates repo from above
* decide on which battery technology is best for this project
* place a hole cutout for ornament string

Above is where I got to after focusing more on Altium configuration. The thought is to have all LEDs in parallel from one battery source. Added placeholder resistor to avoid burning out LEDs with too much current. I would ideally like to use a CR3032 coin battery as I'm used to them and they're readily available but I will run into voltage drop issues.

Will need to consider other battery options; perhaps a LiPo or a Li-ion battery. Will also need to compute out exactly how much voltage drop and resistance to expect.

* Li-ion - allows for charging would is a new capability for the board, more expensive
* LiPo - safety concerns

Fixed an issue with my Altium libraries not being available across projects. Now my footprints load without a problem. 

Set up the initial PCB file including a circle shape for the ornament. Currently 4" diameter but will likely shrink if using 0603 components. Will also do a cutout for the ornament string at some point.

Changed component supplier preferences to just Digikey and Mouser. Added supplier links to all components used thus far. Picked out an on/off switch with the PCM12SMTR; still need to implement in circuit.
