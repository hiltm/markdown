# Christmas Ornament
## Project Overview
In my professiomal life, I have laid out multiple printed circuit boards including circuit design, board layout, and fabrication documentation. However, I wanted to have some projects to display that were not owned by the organizations that I could show off on my portfolio. Starting a (presumably) simple project to get my workflow set up. The project I have planned is a Christmas ornament that lights up my last name in LEDs.

## Project Requirements/Desires
* done in Altium
* 2 layer board
* circular PCB form
* powered from coin battery
* green and red LEDs
* an on/off switch
* a speaker and Christmas songs saved

## Next Steps/ToDos
* set up Altium personal templates
    * used [Altium Templates from Github user Fermium](https://github.com/Fermium/AltiumTemplates)
* set up personal part number tracking
    * perhaps not very interesting but XXX-YYYY where XXX is sequential project number depending on what's being worked and YYYY is another sequential for new part numbers within a project
* set up part footprint repository
    * this is also kept in the personal templates repo from above
* decide on which battery technology is best for this project
* place a hole cutout for ornament string

Above is where I got to after focusing more on Altium configuration. The thought is to have all LEDs in parallel from one battery source. Added placeholder resistor to avoid burning out LEDs with too much current. I would ideally like to use a CR3032 coin battery as I'm used to them and they're readily available but I will run into voltage drop issues.

Will need to consider other battery options; perhaps a LiPo or a Li-ion battery. Will also need to compute out exactly how much voltage drop and resistance to expect.

* Li-ion - allows for charging would is a new capability for the board, more expensive
* LiPo - safety concerns 
* NiMHb- cheaper, shorter lifespan compared to Li-ion, less capacity

Fixed an issue with my Altium libraries not being available across projects. Now my footprints load without a problem. 

Set up the initial PCB file including a circle shape for the ornament. Currently 4" diameter but will likely shrink if using 0603 components. Will also do a cutout for the ornament string at some point.

Changed component supplier preferences to just Digikey and Mouser. Added supplier links to all components used thus far. Picked out an on/off switch with the PCM12SMTR; still need to implement in circuit.

### June 4, 2024
Researching battery options. LiPo doesn't have good form factor, it seems more geared for RC cars and projects with space for battery trays. 

I am eyeing 18650 size lithium ion batteries. I found a dual battery holder that would fit mechanically on the back of my board (Mouser part # 534-1047). Cheaper options exist elsewhere. Now researching recharge circuit and will draft up shortly.

### June 7, 2024
Adding battery holder to circuit. Completed nodal analysis to determine resistor values. Since the LEDs selected are 0603 package, I will select resistors to be the same. 
* 3.7V batteries in series for 7.4V supply voltage.
* 150060GS7500 green LEDs have 3.2V forward voltage at 20mA. Two in series is 6.4V voltage drop. 1V remaining divided by 20mA results in 50立. 
* 150060SS7500 red LEDs have 1.9V  forward voltage at 20mA. Three in series is 5.7V voltage drop. 1.7V remaining divided by 20mA results in 85立.
* Since the LEDs selected are 0603 package, I will select resistors to be the same. For such low volume, I will select 1% tolerance and spec up the power higher than needed to 1/3W.
* 85立 not available to going higher to 91立. Will result in slightly dimmer LEDs but that's fine.
